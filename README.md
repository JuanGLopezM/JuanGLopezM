### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a web developer with knowledge
of: React, Node, MongoDB, Express,
HTML5 and several CSS frameworks.

After a few years in the legal sector I
decided to do the Web Dev bootcamp
at Ironhack, where apart from doing
fullstack development projects, I have
also been able to put my ambition and
teamwork into practice.

I am looking forward to putting my
knowledge into practice
