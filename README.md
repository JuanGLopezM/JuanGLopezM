### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**JuanGLopezM/JuanGLopezM** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am a web developer with knowledge
of: React, Node, MongoDB, Express,
HTML5 and several CSS frameworks.
After a few years in the legal sector I
decided to do the Web Dev bootcamp
at Ironhack, where apart from doing
fullstack development projects, I have
also been able to put my ambition and
teamwork into practice.
I am looking forward to putting my
knowledge into practice
